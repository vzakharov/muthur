## What this skill is for

Getting a fix in front of users **now**, when waiting for the normal release
path is not acceptable — and doing it without leaving the branch topology in a
state where the fix silently disappears later.

It exists because "is the trunk safe to ship right now?" is a question you
cannot always answer yes to. If the trunk has half-finished work on it, shipping
from the trunk to fix one bug ships everything else too. The hotfix path is the
answer to that, and it is _only_ worth having if the project's trunk can be in
that state.

## Concerns that hold regardless of stack

### Branch off what's live, not the trunk

The whole point is to avoid carrying unrelated in-flight work. Cut from the ref
that represents production — a branch, a tag, the deployed SHA — never from the
trunk. Hydration must name that ref precisely.

### It bypasses the promotion path

Whatever staged gauntlet the normal release runs, this skips most of it by
design. Say explicitly which checks still apply. A hotfix that skips
_everything_ isn't fast, it's unreviewed.

### Reconcile back into the trunk, or lose it

A fix that only exists on the production ref gets overwritten by the next
ordinary release. Merging it back into the trunk is part of the procedure, not a
follow-up someone might remember — and the skill should not report success until
it's done or explicitly deferred with an owner.

### It needs a durable record

Hotfixes happen under time pressure and are the changes least likely to be
written down. Decide where the record goes (a notes file, an issue, a PR that
stays open until reconciled) and make writing it non-optional.

### Scope discipline

The urgency that justifies the bypass applies to one fix. Anything that rides
along on the branch inherits a review path it didn't earn. Keep the diff minimal
and say so in the report.

### A hotfix still runs the task route

A hotfix is still work left in the repo, so it runs the route
`@.claude/skills/task/repo-change.md` gives such a skill. Its deviations are the
ones above — the base it branches from, the checks it skips, the reconcile it
adds — and hydration names them against that route rather than writing a second
procedure.

## Related

`/release` is the ordinary path this one deliberately steps around; hydrate that
first, since this skill is defined by what it skips. `/squash-message` expects a
hotfix body to be one or two paragraphs — short, not padded out to look
substantial.
