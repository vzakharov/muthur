description: Take a GitHub issue onto the branch — export the thread and its attachments, commit them, and hand the number back to whoever called. Invoke as `/take-issue <number|url>`; its callers are `/task`, `/plan` and `/go`, each running it first when the prompt carries a `#<N>`.
---

End state of this skill: `docs/issue/<n>/` holds the thread and its attachments, that export is committed on the branch, you have read it, and control is back with the caller — which is where every decision about the work is made.

This skill decides nothing. It is the one place an issue gets pulled onto a branch, so its contract to its callers is that the issue has been **taken**: exported, committed, and there for a later session to re-read.

## Argument shape

The argument is an issue number or a full issue URL, optionally with prose around it — `fix the sidebar scroll #847` is the same invocation as `847`. The prose is the operator's own summary of the issue and is worth reading as a hint at what they care about, but **the export outranks it**: where the two disagree, the thread is what the work is against.

## Step 0 — Mode gate: native plan mode is not supported

If the session is in **native plan mode** — the launch banner or system prompt says so, `ExitPlanMode` is the offered exit, or an edit is refused for that reason — **stop before running anything below.** Tell the operator:

- this flow is plan-**file**-based (`@.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md`), and native plan mode cannot write the two artifacts it depends on: the export under `docs/issue/<n>/` and the plan under `docs/plans/`. Both must be committed and pushed, because the operator reviews from a different machine than the one you run on;
- the plan-mode approval UI is unreliable in web sessions regardless (anthropics/claude-code#72704);
- so switch to **accept-edits** or **auto** and send any reply — the run picks up from there; no re-invocation needed.

Do not work around it, and do not fall back to a chat-only plan.

## Step 1 — Export the issue locally (then read the export)

**First command:** run the bundled exporter:

```bash
python3 scripts/export-github-item.py <issue-number|https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N> [--repo OWNER/REPO]
```

The script writes `docs/issue/<n>/issue.md` (body + comments + timeline) and downloads any image / file attachments referenced in the thread to `docs/issue/<n>/attachments/`.

Consult the issue only through the export — never `gh issue view`, the GitHub MCP tools, or `WebFetch` in its place. `gh issue view` alone does **not** fetch attachments: GitHub's `private-user-images.githubusercontent.com` URLs require an authenticated request even when the issue is public, which is why the export script exists. `WebFetch` on a github.com issue page often fails outright in isolated environments. For a quick metadata check unrelated to the task at hand — labels, assignees, linked PRs — `gh issue view <n> --json title,body,labels,assignees,state,url` is still fine.

**Then read** `docs/issue/<n>/issue.md` end to end, and **open the files under** `docs/issue/<n>/attachments/` when you need pixels (screenshots, mockups, design references).

**Auth:** the script reads `$GH_TOKEN` (or `$GITHUB_TOKEN`) first, then falls back to `gh auth token`. One of those must be available. **Deps:** stdlib Python 3.9+ only — no `pip install` needed.

**Repo:** if `--repo OWNER/REPO` is omitted and the argument isn't a full issue URL, the script reads `origin` from the current git checkout. Pass `--repo` explicitly when exporting an issue from a different repo than the one you're working in.

If the export fails, **stop and report** — do not start solving the task from the title alone. Tell the user what failed and how to proceed. The script exits non-zero on every failure — auth, network, repo not found, or an attachment that wouldn't download — so check the status, not just the last line. A partial attachment failure still writes the Markdown and prints `Downloaded 2/3 attachment(s)` plus each URL it missed: the thread is there, but you'd be reading it with pixels missing.

### Video attachments (screen recordings)

Exported attachments may have no extension (the filename stem is the asset id), so `file docs/issue/<n>/attachments/<asset-id>` to spot videos (e.g. `ISO Media, Apple QuickTime movie`). You can read **images** but not play **videos**. Extract frames with `ffmpeg`, if it's available, and read the frames as images:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/frames   # tmp/ is gitignored — never commit frames
ffmpeg -y -i docs/issue/<n>/attachments/<asset-id> -vf fps=2 -q:v 3 tmp/frames/frame_%03d.jpg
```

- `fps=2` (two frames/sec) suits a short clip; lower to `fps=1` for long videos, raise to `fps=4` to catch a fast transient (a toast, a flashed error). Check length first with `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 <path>`.
- Read first/middle/last frames, then bisect toward the moment of interest. Frame `N` ≈ `N / fps` seconds, so you can map a frame back to a timestamp and correlate it with logs.
- Recovers visuals only (no audio) — usually enough for a UI/repro bug.

## Step 2 — Commit the export

```bash
git add docs/issue/<n> && git commit -m "docs: #<n> export the issue"
```

Commit it **now**, before any planning. The export is the source of truth for what the issue says, so an agent resuming this branch — after a context wipe, a handoff, or in a parallel session — re-reads the thread instead of re-exporting it, and committing it up front means that holds even if the session dies mid-plan. Never commit it on the trunk or a promotion branch.

`@.claude/skills/finalize/SKILL.md` deletes the whole `docs/issue/` tree in the last commit before `gh pr ready`, so this add and that delete cancel out in the squash. **You** must not delete it.

## Step 3 — Return to the caller

Hand back the export path (`docs/issue/<n>/issue.md`) and the number. **Whether it is the number a PR closes is the caller's to decide**, and often it isn't one: an issue taken for context — a related report, the thread a decision was argued in, the parent of a carve — is read and closes nothing. Where the caller carves, `@.claude/skills/plan/carving.md` settles which number the PR closes.

Then stop. Everything downstream belongs to the caller.
